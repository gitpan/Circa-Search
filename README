WHAT IS THIS ?

This is Circa::Search, a module who provide functions to 
perform search on Circa, a www search engine running with 
Mysql. Circa is for your Web site, or for a list of sites. 
It indexes like Altavista does. It can read, add and 
parse all url's found in a page. It add url and word 
to MySQL for use it at search.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT ?

To install this module, cd to the directory that contains
this README file and type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If this doesn't work for you, try:

   cp Search.pm /usr/local/lib/perl5/Circa

If you have trouble installing Search.pm because you have 
insufficient access privileges to add to the perl library 
directory, you can still use Search.pm.  See the docs in 
directory demo for details.

FEATURES ?

+ Different weights for title, keywords, description and 
rest of page HTML read can be given in configuration

a head http request, for information such as validate, 
last update, size, etc.

all documents > 5 MB). For use with low-bandwidth 
connections, or computers which do not have much memory.

HTTP serveur load. Index the different links found 
in a CGI (all after name_of_file?) 

+ Support proxy HTTP 

BENCHMARK ?
